## Design

### Colour Scheme

The main colour theme for this site is Black and Gold — portraying the site as luxurious for enticement.

```css
.gold-1 {
  color: #caa126 !important;
}

.gold-2 {
  color: #b8860b !important;
}
```

- I have used `color: #caa126` for headings and buttons.
- I have used `color: #B8860B` for all other texts.
- I have used `background-color: black;` for the body of each page and text that are on white background cards.
- I have used `background-color: rgb(45, 45, 45)` for the navbar to stand out a little bit from the body

  ![The Color Scheme](media/images/readme_images/colours.png)

### Typography

The typography of site has been carefully chosen to provide a clean, modern, and highly readable experience for users. The website uses a google font called .cinzel-regular for headings and gold text. The site also uses the Arial, Helvetica, and sans-serif font families for consistency and accessibility across all devices and platforms.

```css
body {
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
```

![The Color Scheme](media/images/readme_images/font.png)

Key Reasons for Choosing This Typography:

- Cinzel: A very fancy font but very clear to read font. It suits the luxurious intent without compromising readability. It also give an Arabic feel which is the style of the perfume oils.

- Arial: A widely used, legible sans-serif typeface, known for its simplicity and modern look. It ensures a clean and professional aesthetic throughout the website.

- Helvetica: A classic sans-serif typeface, used as a fallback to ensure a high-quality user experience on systems where Arial might not be available.

- Sans-serif: This acts as a final fallback for any system that does not support the previous two fonts, ensuring text remains clear and readable.

By using these fonts, we ensure that site maintains a consistent appearance across different browsers and devices, providing a reliable and accessible interface for all users.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created using Figma.

  ![Logo](media/images/readme_images/navbar-4.png)

#### Register Form

The user registration form is an essential feature of the platform, allowing new users to create accounts. It is designed to collect critical information securely and ensure a smooth onboarding experience. The form captures details such as the username, email address, and password, with a confirmation field to verify the password entry. Validation mechanisms ensure all fields are completed correctly. The username and email must be unique, while passwords must meet strength requirements for security. Users receive instant feedback if there are errors, such as missing fields, duplicate information, or password mismatches.

Once the user submits the form, the data is securely processed and stored in the database. If the information is valid, a new account is created. Upon successful registration, the user is redirected to the add delivery address page and automatically logged into their new account. This form ensures a balance between user convenience and robust security measures.

![Reg Form](media/images/readme_images/reg-form.png)

#### Add Delivery Address

The add delivery address form is a feature that allows users to input and save their delivery address information to ensure accurate and efficient order fulfillment. This form collects essential details, including the street address, city, postal code, country, and an optional phone number. Each field is clearly labeled, providing users with guidance on the required input.

Validation is applied to ensure the data is accurate. Fields such as street address, city, postal code, and country are mandatory, while the phone number is validated to confirm it matches the expected format. Error messages are displayed if any field is missing or incorrectly formatted, helping users correct mistakes before submission.

Once the form is completed and submitted, the information is securely processed and stored in the database. Users can later update their saved address if needed via the navbar element which shows the form again but prepopulated with the user's submitted info and with a header to say it's for edditing the address. This form is designed to streamline the checkout process by preloading saved addresses, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience. It emphasizes simplicity, accuracy, and functionality, enhancing user satisfaction while supporting operational efficiency. Users are then redirected to the home page which displays all perfumes for purchasing.

![Address Form](media/images/readme_images/address-form.png)

#### Home Page

The home page has the main title of the shop "Cass Galaar" with the slogan beneath it; "Perfume as it should be"
The home page serves as the main shopping page displaying all the available perfumes for sale being displayed as cards with images. The perfume product cards are designed with interactive hover effects that enhance the user experience and indicate the selectability of each product. The hover effects are intuitive and provide immediate feedback, making it easy for users to navigate through the available fragrances.

The hover effect draws attention to the product, inviting users to click and explore further, leading them seamlessly to the perfume details page. This feature ensures an engaging and smooth navigation experience, enhancing the overall usability of the site and encouraging deeper exploration of the perfume offerings.

All the nav links in the header and the footer itself is from the base file which is extended to every page of the site.

![Home Page](media/images/readme_images/website-screenshot.png)

#### Perfume Details Page

The perfume details page offers a comprehensive and user-friendly view of the selected fragrance, designed to provide all the essential information in a clean and organized layout. The page has the image of the selected perfume and the perfume's name and a detailed description, giving users a deeper understanding of its scent profile, ingredients, and overall appeal.

In addition to the product information, the page includes an intuitive option to select the desired size of the perfume, with choices for 25 ml, 50 ml, and 75 ml bottles. This feature allows users to easily customize their purchase according to their preferences, and the customer can select how many units of the perfume they want with a display of the price of a single unit.

A clearly visible "Add to Cart" button provides a seamless transition to the shopping cart, enabling users to effortlessly add the selected perfume and proceed with their shopping experience.

![Perfume Details Page](media/images/readme_images/details.png)

#### Shopping Cart Page

The shopping cart page presents a clear and organized list of the items added to the cart, with each product displayed in its own card. Each item card includes essential details such as the perfume name, selected size, quantity, the total price for that quantity and a button to remove from the cart. The cart states that it is empty when it has no items in the list. This layout ensures users can easily review their selections and make adjustments as needed.

At the bottom of the page, the total price of all items in the cart is displayed prominently, giving users a clear overview of their total purchase cost. A "Proceed to Payment" button is also featured, directing users to the secure payment system hosted by Stripe. This button allows for a smooth and seamless transition to the checkout process, providing a straightforward path to finalize the purchase.

![Shopping Cart Page](media/images/readme_images/cart.png)

#### Stripe

The payment page is designed to provide a secure and seamless checkout experience for users. On the left side of the page, users can easily review the details of their selected item(s), including perfume and price, ensuring they are ready to complete their purchase. This section provides a clear summary of the order, helping users confirm the items they are paying for.

On the right side, the Stripe payment gateway is integrated, allowing users to securely enter their payment details, including credit or debit card information. The payment form is user-friendly and straightforward, guiding users through the process with clear instructions. Once payment details are entered, users can confidently complete their purchase, knowing their transaction is processed securely through Stripe.

![Stripe](media/images/readme_images/stripe.png)

#### Payment Feedback Pages

The payment confirmation page provides users with a clear and straightforward message about the status of their transaction. If the payment is successful, the page will display a simple "Payment Successful" message, along with a brief thank-you note and an option to continue browsing, reassuring users that their purchase has been processed successfully.

If the payment is not successful, the page will display a "Payment Cancelled" message, along with a prompt to try again. Users are encouraged to check their payment details or contact support if necessary. This page ensures users are informed of the outcome of their transaction in a simple, direct, and user-friendly manner, offering clarity regardless of the payment result.

![Success Page](media/images/readme_images/success.png)
![Cancelled Page](media/images/readme_images/cancelled.png)

#### Login and Logout Pages

The login page is designed to provide a simple and efficient way for users to access their accounts. It features a straightforward form with fields for the username and password, allowing users to securely log in to their accounts. The form is clean and easy to navigate, ensuring a smooth login process with minimal distractions.

The logout page provides a clear message confirming that the user has successfully logged out of their account. It also includes a prompt with a blue, clickable link that reads "Log in again," allowing users to easily return to the login page if they wish to sign in again. The logout page is simple, focusing on the confirmation of the logout action and providing an intuitive link for easy navigation back to the login page.

![Login Page](media/images/readme_images/login.png)
![Logout Page](media/images/readme_images/logout.png)

### Future Implementations

In future implementations I would like to:

1. Integrate the address form only when the user decides to pay.
2. Add a 'pay now' button instead of a single button that goes straight to the shopping cart (so the user can add many before being forced to got to the cart)
3. Allow the user to contact me via email to raise any concerns or suggestions.
4. Allow users to search explicitely for male or female as there's a catogory in the data model for that.

### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. This has been achieved by:

- Using semantic HTML.
- Using a hover state on all buttons and links on the site to make it clear to the user if they are hovering over a button.
- Choosing a sans serif type font for the site - these fonts are suitable for people with dyslexia.
- Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
- Ensuring that all nav links and buttons are keyboard focusable.

For the input fields on the form, I used the `label` tag with the `for` attribute. This makes it easier for users, especially for those with motor impairments or those who might have difficulty clicking on small targets, to interact with the input field.

```html
<div class="form-group">
  <label for="{{ form.postal_code.id_for_label }}">Postal Code</label>
  <input
    type="text"
    name="postal_code"
    class="form-control"
    id="{{ form.postal_code.id_for_label }}"
    required
  />
</div>
```

## Deployment & Local Development

### Deployment to Github

The hosting platform that I've used for my project is GitHub Pages and Heroku. To deploy my website to GitHub pages, I used the following steps:

1. Press `ctrl+'` in VS Code which opens the integrated terminal in the root directory of the project folder.

2. Initialise Git using the `git init` command.

3. Add all files to the staging area using the `git add .` command.

4. Commit the files using the `git commit -m "First commit"` command.

5. Create a new repository in GitHub called 'Milestone-3-Code-Institute'.

6. Copy the code with the origin that GitHub provides and paste into the terminal window:

   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/david-walters/final-project-code-institute.git

   git push -u origin main

   ```

### Deployment to Heroku

To deploy the project to **Heroku** using the **Heroku GUI**, I followed these steps:

1. Ensure all necessary dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. This file tells Heroku which packages to install. If it's missing, you can generate it by running this command in your terminal:

```bash
    pip freeze > requirements.txt

```

2. Create a Procfile in the root directory of the project to tell Heroku how to run the application. The Procfile contains the following:

```bash
    web: gunicorn run:app

```

3. Make sure that your project files, including requirements.txt and Procfile, are committed to your repository:

```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Prepared project for Heroku deployment"

```

4. Log in to Heroku by going to https://heroku.com and signing in.

5. Once logged in, click on the New button in the Heroku Dashboard and select Create New App.

6. Choose a unique app name, select the region closest to you, and click Create App.

7. In the app dashboard, go to the Deploy tab.

8. Under the Deployment method, select GitHub.

9. Connect your Heroku app to the GitHub repository by searching for your repository name and clicking Connect.

10. Scroll down to the Automatic deploys section and choose the branch you want to deploy (usually main or master). Then, click Enable Automatic Deploys or Deploy Branch if you're deploying manually.

11. After deployment, Heroku will automatically build and deploy your app. Once it’s done, click the View button at the bottom of the page to see your live application.

12. Ensure that environment variables such as SECRET_KEY, DATABASE_URL, and others are set up correctly in the Settings tab by clicking Reveal Config Vars and adding the appropriate key-value pairs.

13. Finally, run migrations on Heroku to create the necessary database structure:

| :-- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | No images showing on Heroku: The images were not displaying on the deployed site.            | I solved this by hosting the images on ImageBB and adding their direct URLs to the database. This ensured that the images were accessible on Heroku.                                                      |
| 2   | Duplicate listings of each perfume: The database had multiple instances of the same perfume. | I resolved this by creating a new server in pgAdmin4, linking it to the database provided by Code Institute, manually deleting the duplicates, and re-populating the database with the corrected entries. |
|     |

### Unresolved Bugs

I had an issue with selecting larger sizes and reflecting the total price in the cart as the total price was not updating to the larger sizes. I resolved them temporarily by making the larger sizes unselectable with a note saying Out of Stock until it is resolved.

## Credits

### Code Used

I utilised several external resources to complete this project:

- I used Bootstrap v4.6.2 for the responsive grid system, prebuilt components, and styles, which I customized to suit the needs of the project.

- I referred to Django tutorials to properly set up the application, configure the database, and implement routing and views.

- Heroku was instrumental for deployment, and I used their resources to troubleshoot issues and ensure smooth hosting for the app.

### Personal Overview

This project has been a rewarding experience from start to finish. I encountered a few challenges, but each hurdle provided an opportunity to deepen my understanding of Django and deployment environments. Working through these issues gave me a much better grasp of how to manage a full-stack web application.

Overall, I’m proud of the progress I've made in this project, and I look forward to applying the lessons learned here to future projects. It’s been a great journey, and I can’t wait to share more of my work!

Thanks for checking out my project!
