Testing was ongoing throughout the entire build of this project. During development I made use of the console inside VS-Code to read about the errors that occurred in order to correct them, and the console in Google dev tools and to check the network.

I have gone through each page using google chrome developer tools & Firefox inspector tool to ensure that each page is responsive on a variety of different screen sizes and devices and to ensure that the keyframes also work on different browsers.

## AUTOMATED TESTING

### Standard Automated Tests

[W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. It was also used to validate the CSS. All the pages had no errors except that the validator didn't understand Jinja templating.

All python files were tested using `pylint`. Through this I fixed lenghty lines, trailing white spaces, applied docstrings where relevent, and prioritised imports.

My JS files was tested using JSHint and returened with zero errors.

### Lighthouse

I used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.

#### Desktop Results

All pages of the site are achieving a score above 90 except for best practices. The only thing that has impacted the best practices is Stripes use of cookies.

#### Mobile Results

Each page was only impacted by the image loading but still above 80 for everything except for the same issue of cookies due to stripe.

#### CRUD Functionality

The website implements full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, enabling users to manage their accounts and shopping experience effectively. Users can register a new account, which is the "Create" function, allowing them to enter personal details. Once registered, they can add a delivery address, which is also part of the "Create" functionality, ensuring that their orders are sent to the correct location.

Users are able to view (or "Read") their information, such as their delivery address, shopping cart, and available perfumes for purchase.

If necessary, users can edit (or "Update") their delivery address, which provides flexibility in case they need to change the location for their orders. Additionally, users can add items to their shopping cart, giving them the ability to select products they wish to purchase.

Finally, users can remove items from their shopping cart if they decide not to buy them. This represents the "Delete" functionality, offering the user complete control over their cart's contents.
